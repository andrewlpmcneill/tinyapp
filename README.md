# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

This application features method overrides for PUT and DELETE requests.

For each URL created, this application also features total view count, unique view count, a creation timestamp, and a log of every viewer.
